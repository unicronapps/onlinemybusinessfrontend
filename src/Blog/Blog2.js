              3. Register Your Business
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Registering a business in India can involve many types of
              entities, such as Private Limited companies, One Person Companies,
              proprietorship firms, etc., but we will start with the basics. To
              register a proprietorship, you need a GST number, though it is not
              mandatory initially. You can start a business without a GST number
              and later obtain it as the business grows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below are some points to consider for applying for GST: a. If your
              annual aggregate turnover exceeds ₹40 lakhs for goods. b. If your
              annual aggregate turnover exceeds ₹20 lakhs for services. c. If
              you are selling through any e-commerce aggregator like Amazon,
              Flipkart, or Meesho. d. If you want to sell on your website, you
              will need a payment gateway, which requires a GST number. e. If
              you are willing to sell interstate, regardless of turnover. f. If
              you are part of the special category, you will need a GST number
              to operate your business. Please read this detailed guide for GST
              registration in India.

              4. Build the Website{" "}
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              It’s up to you when you want to start building a website. Many
              customers prefer buying from a website rather than making a
              payment via PhonePe or Paytm and confirming it through a call or
              WhatsApp.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              For many, this process seems like a hassle, and businesses can
              lose potential customers due to this. Having a professional
              website increases your business credibility. Additionally, it
              allows your business to operate 24/7 and enables automation as
              your business grows.
            </p>
            <p>
              While creating content on Instagram and Facebook has its
              limitations in showcasing products and services, a website makes
              it easier to display all your offerings in one place. A website
              also helps in targeting customers globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your website has proper tracking and analytics, you will gain
              insights into customer preferences, allowing you to improve your
              business based on audience behavior.

              6. Spread the Word
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              In India, there is a popular saying:
            </p>
            <p className="italic text-gray-800">
              "Jungle mein mor nacha, kisne dekha?"
            </p>
            <p>
              Translated to English:
              <span className="italic">
                “A peacock danced in the forest—really? Who saw that?”
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The meaning is clear: efforts and talent that remain hidden and
              unnoticed will have little impact. Even if a peacock danced
              beautifully in the jungle, no one benefits from its performance
              without an audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same applies to business. You may be creating content, writing
              blog posts, or building a website, but if no one sees it, all your
              efforts are wasted. You need a proper marketing and advertising
              strategy.

            <p>
              Focus on <strong>SEO</strong> or run ads on various platforms.

            </p>
            <p>
              We will discuss these methods in greater detail as we move
              forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>SEO – Search Engine Optimization</strong>
              <br />
              When a user searches for a good or service on Google or any other
              search engine, if your website appears on the top pages, you have
              a higher chance of converting that audience into potential
              customers. The technique to achieve this is called Search Engine
              Optimization (SEO).
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Share Content</strong>
              <br />
              Build a community of people on social media platforms where you
              can share the content you create.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Write Blogs (Optional)</strong>
              <br />
              If you provide a service, writing blog posts can help explain your
              services, how they work, and what sets you apart. Blogging
              demonstrates your expertise and makes your business appear
              trustworthy.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Email Marketing</strong>
              <br />
              Though email marketing may seem like an outdated strategy, it
              still works. Sending emails about your products or services to a
              targeted audience can generate leads for your business.

              7. Keep Customers Happy
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Happy customers are likely to return and recommend your business
              to others. Making customers happy should be your top priority.
            </p>
            <p>
              In online business, gaining customers is one of the toughest
              challenges because of the trust factor. Once someone becomes your
              customer, ensure they receive proper service and goods to leave a
              positive impression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many businesses initially gained one client after months of
              effort, and that client recommended them to others, creating a
              chain that helped them grow into multimillion-dollar ventures
              (even without a marketing budget).
            </p>
            <p>
              Building trust and satisfaction with your customers is both the
              biggest challenge and the most rewarding task for your business.

            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Always remember that business is a long-term endeavor. Things will
              go right or wrong depending on the situation, but you must keep
              moving forward, focusing on long-term success rather than
              short-term wins or losses.
